## DAOsign

### Project Description
DAOsign is a Workflow Management Platform built with a Decentralized Smart Signature protocol.

DAOsign offers a decentralized and customizable platform where collaboration, authorization, and workflow management are facilitated through cryptographic proofs stored on a blockchain

The Decentralized Smart Signature protocol serves as the cornerstone technology of DAOsign, encompassing a comprehensive system of cryptographic proofs, including identity, authority, signature, and agreement.

With Smart Signature, users gain access to a secure and customizable workflow management system. It also allows for control over team authorities and the ability to verify the signer’s identity.

We offer to build DAOsign on top of the Darwinia, allowing users to store their proofs on this chain. Apart from that, we propose to build a Grant Management workflow using DAOsign for the Darwinia chain. DAOsign will serve as a central tool for overseeing Darwinia grants, ensuring transparency and security at every stage of the grant application process, from voting to fund distribution, milestone delivery, and verification. All the proofs will be securely stored on the Darwinia chain, thereby enhancing the integrity of the Darwinia ecosystem. We haven’t found any similar product within the Darwinia Ecosystem and would be happy to be the first to develop it!

Please take a look at the [non-functional prototype for Grant Management workflow](https://www.figma.com/proto/FwYGQ7CLTtzo0nyGpVvF0Z/DAOsign-Grant-Proposal?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2-6051&viewport=19%2C-348%2C0.16&t=9sMKfPGMe9AMlNBL-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2%3A6051). Once the grant is approved, we will create it specifically for the Darwinia blockchain, using custom labels, domain, and CSS.

### Additional Information

Currently, DAOsign is on the Testnet: https://testnet.daosign.org/connect. We already allow users to store their proofs on the Ethereum, Sui, Polkadot, and Oasis blockchains. We received grants from Sui, Polkadot, Mintbase, Oasis, and Planq. Apart from that, we are communicating with some other Networks such as Coreum, Solana, and Kadena to implement our Grant Management use case for them. 

As for the competitive landscape, we have two types of competitors: electronic signature platforms, like DocuSign or EthSign, and workflow automation platforms, such as Chronicled or Everledger.
